[00:20.94] Maybe if I had something to say
[00:23.71] Butterfly effect from the last three days now
[00:26.47] Maybe if I had something to save
[00:29.02] I used to have a soul until I threw it away
[00:50.52] 
[00:31.62] There's shadows on the wall, wish I would've ran
[00:34.54] Gotta get away, I hope you understand
[00:37.17] I try to hide my face like a wanted man
[00:40.08] Maybe I'll be gone before you count to ten
[01:01.08] 
[00:42.49] I made up my mind this evening
[00:45.78] I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
[00:48.62] Drink while my conscience eats me
[00:51.32] I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
[01:11.32] 
[00:54.88] I'm ready to let you go
[00:57.68] I'm ready to let you go
[01:00.30] I'm ready to let you go
[01:02.20] This time is the last, this time is the last
[01:24.20] 
[01:10.06] Maybe if we went another way (another way)
[01:12.74] I wouldn't be regretting the decisions that I made
[01:15.37] I don't want to spend another day (another day)
[01:18.12] Looking for somebody that I know I can't replace
[01:42.12] 
[01:20.75] My tears fall, you don't miss me
[01:23.75] Put me out my misery
[01:26.28] Think my heart is history
[01:29.27] I think I'm broke and nothing can fix me
[01:49.27] 
[01:31.76] I made up my mind this evening
[01:34.77] I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
[01:37.66] Drink while my conscience eats me
[01:40.42] I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
[02:00.42] 
[01:44.01] I'm ready to let you go
[01:46.65] I'm ready to let you go
[01:49.34] I'm ready to let you go
[01:50.98] This time is the last, this time is the last
[02:12.98] 
[01:53.75] Yeah (mmm)
[01:57.29] We were built to fall apart
[02:01.52] But I can't feel you now
[02:04.28] And it's too late now, there's no point screaming
[02:07.23] You dug your grave, so fuck your feelings
[02:09.98] No one's here, so now you're on your own
[02:29.98] 
[02:14.75] I made up my mind this evening
[02:18.64] I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
[02:21.37] Drink while my conscience eats me
[02:24.07] I'm taking the last, I'm taking the last
[02:44.07] 
[02:27.65] I'm ready to let you go
[02:30.17] I'm ready to let you go
[02:33.06] I'm ready to let you go
[02:34.95] This time is the last, this time is the last
